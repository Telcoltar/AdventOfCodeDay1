# Advent of Code Day 1
[Link to Avent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

I have tried three solution for Part 1 of Advent of Code Day 1.
The obvision solution and two solution of runtime O(n log n) (mediate)
and O(n) (faster). The file compareSolutions will compare the runtimes
of the different solutions. Part 2 has two Solutions. One obvison and one a
little faster based on the fasterSolution. Because the inputData is individual
for each participant, I have not inlcuded mine. You can put you data in a file
called inputData.txt and the code should work fine.
